       <p>The sky is everything that lies above the horizon and surface of the Earth, including the atmosphere and outer space.

        In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial sphere. This is an abstract sphere, concentric to the Earth, on which the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be drifting. The celestial sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called constellations.
        
        Usually, the term sky informally refers to a perspective from the Earth's surface; however, the meaning and usage can vary.</p>
